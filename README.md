This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Summary
This was a simple project I used to practice routing with react router. It will fetch a list of quotes from the Lord of the Rings movies, the names of each of the books, and a list of characters. Clicking a character navigates to a more detailed view of their information.
